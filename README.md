_Create and run a GitHub Actions workflow._

</header>

## Welcome

Automation is key for streamlining your work processes, and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) is the best way to supercharge your workflow.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps engineers, students, managers, teams, GitHub users.
- **What you'll learn**: How to create workflow files, trigger workflows, and find workflow logs.
- **What you'll build**: An Actions workflow that will check emoji shortcode references in Markdown files.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with issues and pull requests, as well as edit files. We recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course first.
- **How long**: This course can be finished in less than two hours.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a workflow
2. Add a job
3. Add a run step
4. Merge your pull request
5. See effect of the workflow

### How to start this course

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=hello-github-actions&owner=%40me&name=skills-hello-github-actions&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new directory in your repository called `.github/workflows`.
   - Create a file named `wallet-transaction.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Add the following content to the `wallet-transaction.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Wallet Transaction Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Filter by Keyword
      if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'CCXT Wallet')
      run: echo "Relevant keyword found in issue"

    - name: Filter by File
      if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}
      run: |
        FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }})
        echo "$FILES" | grep 'transactions/' && echo "Transaction file changed" || echo "No relevant file changes"
```

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

    const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Thanks for opening this issue!' });
    await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
  });
};
```

This setup includes a GitHub Actions workflow for your Python project with CodeQL analysis, a Dependabot configuration for automatic dependency updates, and a simple Probot bot to comment on new issues.**AfricaCryptoChainx Launching Pool Coming Soon!**

We're excited to announce that AfricaCryptoChainx is launching its new pool soon! This innovative pool will allow users to stake their ACCX tokens and earn USDT. We've developed this feature using free tools and our proprietary free bot to ensure accessibility and efficiency for all our users.

**Project Information:**

- **Project Name:** AfricaCryptoChainx
- **Tools Used:** Free tools and free bot

**Example Code Snippets:**

```python
# Example of using a free tool for blockchain transaction
import free_tool

transaction = free_tool.create_transaction(sender="0x123", recipient="0x456", amount=10)
free_tool.sign_and_send(transaction)

# Example of bot interaction
class CryptoBot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def execute_trade(self, amount, price):
        print(f"Executing trade for {amount} tokens at {price} each.")

Powered by open-source technology, it supports financial inclusion and blockchain transparency. Learn more at [AfricaCryptoChainx](https://africacryptochainx.com).### GitHub Actions Workflow for Wallet Transactions

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new directory in your repository called `.github/workflows`.
   - Create a file named `wallet-transaction.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Add the following content to the `wallet-transaction.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Wallet Transaction Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Filter by Keyword
      if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'CCXT Wallet')
      run: echo "Relevant keyword found in issue"

    - name: Filter by File
      if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}
      run: |
        FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }})
        echo "$FILES" | grep 'transactions/' && echo "Transaction file changed" || echo "No relevant file changes"
```

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). ### GitHub Actions Workflow with CodeQL and Python
